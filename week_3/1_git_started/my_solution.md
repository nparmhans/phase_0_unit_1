## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Fetch changes
- Commit locally

## Release 5: Reflection

<!-- I used previous knowledge and looked up how to fetch and pull on github.com. Everything worked out well for me -->

<!-- I used github.com. I did have questions because I wasn't sure how to fetch and pull, but I utilized github.com -->

<!-- I figured out everthing based on the linked provided and previous knowledge on using the terminal -->

<!-- I learned how fetch and pull work together. Very good techniques to use. Also, learned how to branch and checkout. Not sure when I will utilize this yet. -->

<!-- This round I was very confident with my learning competencies -->

<!-- I enjoyed pulling all of the new information from the remote respository to my workspace -->

<!-- Nothing was tedious. Only helpful-->
