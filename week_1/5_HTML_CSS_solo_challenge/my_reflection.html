* During this weeks challenge I found myself repeatedly asking, "Why is css a myth?" Jokes aside I repeatedly asked myself why isn't this working? This technique of asking myself this allows me to break down each part of the problem. I read during this challenge that we should avoid using any online resources; however, I did find it to run throught the links that were already posted in the challenge.  

* I truly struggled for a long time on this challenge in particularly, because in the previous exercise where I was building an introductory webpage, I noticed I was struggling once again with setting the framework on css for the header, sidebars, content and footer. It was driving me mad until I learned how to use the % width opposed to the pixels. I getting much better at the framework, unfortunately I didn't get through to reformatting my last challenge as I did this one. 

* Well, I did discover that using min-height was useful for the side bars, because if I put min-height: 130 px; this basically allows no more than a 130px height unless there is text being written on the side bar that would increase the pixels. The % width was another cool trick I was messing around with because I wanted to compare % with pixels. I also learned that I needed to center the text within the image itself but using vertical-align:center, which was a new trick. 

* I am confident in my learning ability;however, I need to work on speeding up what I was doing because it should have taken me less time. What I enjoy most is being able to adjust the css information within the chrome browser by inspecting the elements of the page. I also now know that elements are the part of the html language. 

* I enjoyed the rudimentary idea of labeling the header, sidebars, content and footer based on their placement on the webpage. Opposed to only knowinge how it works through html and css, you're able to actually understand the concept slightly better when you're labeling it on the webpage. 

* I cannot say that any part of this challenge was tedious. Several reasons why, one being that the rudimentary skills that were being taught as far as formatting the html properly as well as setting up the framework are crucial for webpage building. Secondly, this is exactly the kind of material that helps someone buid a stronger, more complicated webpage in the future because the small basics are critical farther down the road. Lastly, this is DBC nothing here is tedious ;)
