## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

<!-- Add your reflection here. Remove the comment markers -->
* So far I understand that a majority of elements are blocks while the attributes are as inline blocks. Blocks elements begin a new line
on a page, while occupying the full width. Inline blocks fall within the flow of the html doc and appear one the same line they were written. 
What started off as trickey slowly made sense, but not till I was done writting the html doc. I believe I am struggling when it comes to 
maring, border, padding, height, & width. I'm stil discovering how I can still correctly format the content after implementing the header, sidebars, and footer. I'm still utlizing all the sources available to me. 

* What I like about html is the finished product. I'm not trying to have a fixed mind set about the idea of html, but the challange of memorizing the language
has perturbed my 'aha' moments for the time being. Yet some way or another I am still embracing the challenge. I think once I bring together all of the components of html it will be a much smoother ride, but right now html hasn't been my friend on this project.

* The only 'aha' moment I shared this time around is when I began rereading my reflection, I find it extremely helpful to know that i am kind of talking to someone who is going to take into consideration of my struggles. I definitely solidified the concept of the language, but still struggling with the framework
of html

* I love using the resource links that DBC has provided in each of the exercises. I find them to be hella helpful. Especially since the content is very specific to each goal we're attempting to complete. Seldomly did I go outside of the resources that had already been provided to me. Can't think of any I used. Stack Overflow is always a go to when I have questions, but that is pretty standard for me.
