* Created a basic table in html to show date or represent whatever you would like is very straight forward. I also understand
that at the beginning of each html file its starts with <!DOCTYPE html> and ends in </html>. I'm also confident with placing 
my link for the filename.css within the <head> of the html code. I also an cool with using the h1-h6 naming scheme. 
I'm very confident making a new website; howevever, I struggling with aligning images using differnt borders, images and header. 

* What seems awesome is that once I learn more about html I will be able to build a much more complex webpage. Html give you the 
ability to build a website or web application, which is awesome! What seems bad is that once we get deeper into rails I know its
going to be another language to learn merged with ruby and html. 

*This project really got to be, but my 'aha' moment still kicked in once I realized I wasn't able to pull my file.html file from 
github. Really simple concept but still gave me a smile. Plus I learned how to pull files from github and reset the master control. 

*Not this time around. I utilized the webpages that we made available to me in the objectives.
