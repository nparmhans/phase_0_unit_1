<Hello guys, 

Hope all is well. I want to make sure we're all still on for tomorrow evening at 8 pm et, for our hangout chat? I wanted to discuss the past couple of challenges with everyone and get their opinions on everything. 

Best, Stephen


Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

* A student reached out to me about a distint topic regarding relative paths and absolute paths in a private message. I answered his questions, while also asking
for feedback on how I explained the topic to him. I got a 100%! woot woot! At first he seems uneasy, but felt very comfortable once we chatted some more on the 
topic. I felt really confident about the way I described to him how to process of paths works. My experience this week has influenced me to read more so that in
case another student misses information or doesn't understand hopefully I will be able to provide an adequate explanation. I'd imagine as the DBC hands us tougher 
material we're going to want to reach out to classmates, including myself, and I would just like to help my fellow DBC classmates. :)
