*  Today I learned that the web is not the internet, while the internet runs protocols for networks, the web is the information being displayed
by through the internet. The web is used for communication and sharing purposes while the internet is used to help transmit that information to clients.

*  Two important considerations to take into account before setting up your html site is, what is the purpose of the site? As in why are you building the html site, who are its clientel? Secondly, setting up a domain name. Setting up a domain name is essential when building an html site because the the domain name will not only identify your name to users, but a distinct IP address to servers.

*  I got excited that my webpage was fully operation and had an 'aha' moment since I know DBC is going to be throwing tougher obstacles in the next challenege. 

*  haha. Well my 'aha' moment was decribed in my last answer. Heopfully this is helpful :).

*  Absolutely. I found numerous useful resources such as a sublime command I was able to run from my terminal so that I was able to access the file from my computer to sublime2 https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html which was easily my greatest discovery. Since I am using my terminal and not the github app I needed to push, so I needed some help from https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote. Also read over some documentary so I could utilize github much more efficiently http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository.
