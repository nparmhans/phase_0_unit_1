## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* I had previously set up github prior to phase 0 during the prep material period. During this process I learned that 
I need to understand precisely everything that is occurring between my terminal, the git, and github or I will not 
succeed. 

*Git is known as as a version control system(VCS) that makes it possible for users to save work and reflect on those changes
while being able to see who else has committed changes on the source code and when. Git allows us to save different versions
of our work, but only have one final piece of work. The benefit of Git is the branching, essentially meaning you can have 
6 copies of your work and keep track of them all until you realized which one will be the final piece of art that you will 
use as the base by merging. You can then trash the remainders and/or start more branching after. While Git remains local on your
computer, Github is a remote webpage that allows us to upload the work we have so that others can use it to their disposal. 
Github is for storing and accessing work online. 

*Version control keeps track of the changes to the files you make.GitHub becomes useful because it helps store these 
changes. 

*Developers use Git as their version control because it is linked to github. The hub to directly access all of your files
and changes. Git is unique in it sense of branching and merging. This makes lots of sense to me because it provides the 
developer with the option to test code outside of the main framework (master(default branch)). 

* I'm slightly confused on how everything will work once I have a program to utilize for my repository, but I think in time
I will see what I am missing.
