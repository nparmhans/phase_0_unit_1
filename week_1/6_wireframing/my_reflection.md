* Today I learned that becoming a web designer is art that is not something you're born with, you earn and learn how to become a good web designer. For most if not all web designer they go through web design thinking, what is design thinking? Well, its a method that helps designers build a creative web page. I know, right! I had no idea. The example used in the resources DBC provided me with was extremely useful, the issue trying to be tackled was children under the age of 5 in Vietnam turning from malnurished nourished. How it was done? First immersion, observing the outliers, which were the very very poor families who childern are health. Then taking analysis and synthesis, the outliers added tiny shrimps, crabs and snails from rice paddies to thier food. They also had multiple small meals rather than large ones. Next ideation, creating cooking classes for the families with children suffering from malnutrition by replicating the cooking habits of the outliers. Next prototyping, replicate the effore to more villagers. That was a brief example, however, it goes to show that web designer define, research, ideate, and protoype a project before diving in 100%. 

* I was surprised to found out I enjoyed web design even as I worked through the challenge and turned in the assignment late. It was okay working with my web site because I know I will learn a lot more at DBC which will make my site worth while, but I do enjoy messing around with css even as it mystifies me. 

* I created a new book within my Microsoft Notebook where I ask myself questions during each exercise so that I know I can look them back up through the resources link if I need not catch something or if I find it imperative to understand an important point. For instance, I asked myself what is design thinking? Why is it important in web design? Why use web design thinking on business? How am I going to combine all of my information onto one webpage link? What makes a good blog form? Why specificity with passion?

* I am still struggling with css a tad as far as aligning everything up on my IDE with using an html & css file, but sometimes when I push it to my repsoitory and run the webpage url the framework appears shaky. Such as aligning text properly. I work through my problems and ameliorate them each day though, so there is some hope, yes!!

* I am getting much more confident with each learning challenge only because I am getting deeper and deeper into the grid ;). Seriously though, I enjoy web design so far and I want to get superiorly good at building web design by learning how to utilize design thinking. I find that engineering a web page is an amazing art that may not require me to pick up a pen and paper until I plan what I really want. I enjoyed the learning experience throughout the challenge. 

*Nothing. All very helpful.
