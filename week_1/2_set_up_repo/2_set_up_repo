## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Once you've created a github account, on the top right hand corner there will be a +/- symbol click the down arrow then 
select new repository. Once you create a repository the repository name must include your [username].github.io. Be certain
that the Licensing choice is MIT and that the git is public. Finally click create. Once you've created the repository being 
able to access it locally(from you computer) will be key. This is known as cloning. Cloning can be done by the github app
or via Mac terminal (my choice). First open the terminal, type into the command line (~ indication of command not to be typed)
~git init, this intializes a new repository and you're already logged on as the master from your terminal. Next type
~ git clone git@github.com:[USERNAME]/[USERNAME].github.io.git. This will clonse your new repository locally. 

* When running another programmers work all that is viewed will be the output, not the code itself. That is the beauty of 
github it is known as an open source. Open source is when the source code is available to the viewer for changes as they 
believe fit. 

* Open source is an ingenious idea for the reason that it provides the foundation of work for young programmers like myself
who are trying to ameliorate their programming knowledge. Providing the framework for me is essential for programming as I 
like to see how other programmers work. Nervous? Not at all, I want to embrace the challenge. Okay who am I kidding maybe 
a tad nervous when I know there is so much to learn. I enjoyed reading, 'The Giver' in high school, for those of you who 
don't know its based off a utopian society. Anyways to say the least, open source doesn't compare, because of the control
that the programmers have. 

* Licensing is a very confusing topic because many believe they're relinquishing their work when in fact they still hold
original copyright only they granting others to use the source code to for adjustments as that person deems necessary. In
short licensing give permission to others to look and make changes to your work without having to ask special permission. On
github this is quite prominent because of so many users and open source codes, everyone can contribute while the original 
creator still gets credit.

*Omg I love my 'ahah' moments, in fact I had one while reading this question :). I had an 'aha' moment because I was had 
already successfully cloned my repository from my terminal, but kept repeating that step until I finally type the terminal
command ~ ls to list my directories and saw my repository. Oh boy. Lesson learned. I solidified following directions
carefully since I often miss a small piece of directions by trying to move to quickly. 

*I used a github link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4941090/cloning-git-repository-locally , but it wasn't too helpful.
