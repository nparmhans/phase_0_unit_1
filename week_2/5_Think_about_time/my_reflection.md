# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

* My biggest time management issue with phase 0 has been working while programming during phase 0. 

* I am using better time management tools and techniques. 

* I am using a study technique known as tomatoes. Essentially, you set a timer for 25 minutes, you can also do 50 if you'd like but 25 is recommended, and you work only for that amount of time. Once the timer goes off (http://tomato-timer.com/#) you take a 5 minute break, then start another tomato session. After four 25 minute sessions you take a longer break between 10-30 minutes, no more no less and repeat that cycle. How am I utilizing this? I am calculating each activity by asking myself how many tomatoes each challenge will take so that I am better prepared. 

* My overall plan for phase 0 is to keep utilizing my tomato technique, while also enjoying some leisure activities so I don't get my mind cluttered and frustrated with too much material. Those leisure activities include lifting, yoga, meditation, cardio, and the steam room. It's been really helpful in week 2 since I was a little behind in week 1.
