Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I learned that making your web requires a solid wireframe so that you're better able to map out what it is going to appear as. 

* I enjoy web design; however, I need to keep building web pages so I can get a better handle on building a solid web page. I think I got a little frustrated for about an hour until I realized that I wasn't using my maincontainer correctly as far as distributing the block properly. I didn't have fun at first but I finally got there once I finished building my webpage. 
* I followed the 6 phases that was outlines for my in the DBC resources link, Gather information, plan, design, development, testing and delivery and maintenance after the testing. Really helps when you have a constant ebb of web design. I don't think starring at the computer for an hour when you're frustrated works very well at all. 

* I added the new elements for html and section jumping. 

* Yes, I found a little difficulty implementing the media queries for the mobile and tablet size of the web page. Not especially. 

* Yes. I used the W3C html webpage for researching icon fonts.
