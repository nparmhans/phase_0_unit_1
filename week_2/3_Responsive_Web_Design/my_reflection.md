# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Response web design is laying out the design structure for the desktop, tablet and mobile versions of a web page and how the elements will fit into the strucuture. I like web design because it contributes not only to desktop but tablet and mobile as well. Absolutely, its a great practice because we're able to expand our knowledge on multiple views. 

* Smart phones and tablet have contributed to media queries because they're extremely useful when constructing a web page for tablets and phones. I think design will remain the same we are only going to be adapting changes we need to the view. 

* The visually impaired rely on screen readers to read web pages. It would be pretty cool if there was technology that could incorporate touch screen brail. There are also large keyboards for the visually impaired who have are not entirely visionless. We should definitely aim more support to the visually impaired. 

*Â Web design thinking has resonated well with because I definitely hit the drawing board when I first make a web page so that I know where my frame work will stand. In addition to that I want to plan my webpage because it will make for better success and easier web browsing. NOTHING...yet.

* This time around I read through the options resources which was a lot of reading, but very helpful.
