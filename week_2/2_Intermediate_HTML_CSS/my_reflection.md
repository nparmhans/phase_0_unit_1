# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Web standards are enforced for the purpose of good semantics in HTML5 so that your html text is legible. Meaning, it a nice, clean, & easy to follow list of headings with a display of heirarchy. I think web standards give fluidity to the html text. I also believe its a good think that the web has standards, because without it we would all have 'div-itis.'

* The standard structure does makes sense to; however, I truly believe it is more of hands on than anything. So once I start doing it more often the web standard will just be muscle memory when I am writing html text. What I do find most interesting and is somewhat confusing is why we're using a <div> and <section> in the same html file. Why not just use sections? Actually, I believe it so we can use use the attribute <a> to send the page to another sections?

* I enojy the new HTML5 elements. I think one element that stuck out the most to me as most useful in the HTML standards was the <nav> because now I will list all of my links into one section opposed to splitting up the links so much. I think adding the new elements really tells programmers what web developing and software engineering is all about, which is innovation and adding change. This keeps the field up-to-date and stylish opposed to mundane and boring. 

* The reset.css is necessary to give the webpage default style width and sizes. All of the css styles that I added to the index.html file set the margin, padding, border, font-size, font-inherit & vertical-align to a standard that helps solidify the wireframe of the web page. 

* I've used Mozilla, internet explorer(my least favorite of the bunch), and chrome. Chrome is easily the best one. Yes, I did notice that the web pages looked different in different browswers, this is also because the DOM for browsers differ. I think this is a bad thing, because as programmers and web developers we should stand by once standard. 

* I did. http://web.archive.org/web/20120618203051/http://developers.whatwg.org/sections.html#the-article-element - i wanted a better understanding of the new HTML5 elements. So I googled around.
