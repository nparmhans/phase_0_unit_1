# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* The DOM provided me with useful insight on html and javascript. From my understanding html is just text not a language, but once you push your text to a browser it appears differently, meaning you're able to view your html as the newly built website. Or maybe you're not a web developer so just viewing the webpage has not meaning to it. However, the DOM is what is processing the html text and converting it into what we see in the web browser. It has methods that selects html text to run it on the browser. I think the coolest part but also challenginge part is learning how to code in Javascript. Also, every web browser has its own DOM, which would explain why some html types don't functions the same as it would for another browser. From my understanding JS is manipulating the DOM that helps runs your web page so you're able to change certain aspects of the webpage such as optimizing speed. I'm pretty sure I have a pretty clear understandin of the DOM, still don't know JS code but I do understand its meaning, and getting better with html. What's good about the DOM & using JS to manipulate it is you're able to discern the web page differently. For example, I learned that I am able to remove and manipulates the selectors and classes with JS. What could be bad about it? Well, if you don't know what you're doing it could make for a messy web page. 

* Well, when I look at my webpage the the network tab provided no information about download speeds, which makes complete sense since I am not using any videos in my web page yet. Also, as a side note I was really impressed with wordpress.com. I am considering registering for it because you can see who looks at what blogs you post and so forth, AWESOMENESS! I also have no local storage in the chrome tools compared to wordpress.com. I mean, these are professional. Give me some time ;) 

* Chrome web tools was hella fun because I able to read over Javascript and enlighten myself with new information I had never come across before. In addition, chrome web tools provided me with helpful tactics for how to minify files so I am able to optimize the web page speed. In today's society we're all about expediting everything anything from grocery shopping, to internet speed connections, to learning code qiucker (dbc :) ). So, chrome web tools will prove to be even more helpful once I start building stronger, heavier coded web pages. It was unique start trying to find all the selectors and utlizing JS, but I wouldn't say a pain at all! 

* Hmmm. Any 'aha' moments? Honestly, I think I was seriously into DOM and chrom web tools with strong fluidity, so I fortunately didn't struggle, but unfortunately not 'aha' moments this round :( 

* At some points I was struggling on how to print the text, because I was using an ASCII symbol with the single quotes ' ' when all I needed to do was use to " " quotes http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5160823/call-a-function-on-dom-ready-from-outside-head. Other than that I enjoy the resources that DBC has providede me with. Stack overflow is so legit though 8) Oh also tried to print a warning and I looked up the method https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console.warn

* Strategies that keep working for me si time management and minimizing frustration. While these don't sounds like much of computer programming techniques it goes a long way when avoiding frustration and trying to stay focused at the problem(s) at hand. 

* I kept asking myself when this sections was going to end! Seriously though, I often read through directions very quickly, but recently my new technique is to break off each part of the question and ask myself what those parts mean so that I am better able to answer the bigger question. Nothing specific this time around though, since I utilize this technique on an assiduous basis. 

* I was having trouble trying to understand the quiz questions because I wasn't sure if DBC instructors are looking for simple and sweet responses or more in depth, so I provided both. 

* I am gaining more and more confidence with my computer program learning competencies as the days go by. I really am trying to program every day so that this eventually becomes muscle memory. 

* I learned how to utilize the chrome developer tools with more confidence. Before I was only able to edit the css tab; however, now I am running analysis to check web sites speed, looking at js language, and running js commands to the console. 

* I most enjoyed the dev school coding videos. It's nice to be able to have someone explain information from time to time without always having to read so much. My eyes are killing me! 

* For the first time I found the screen shots to be tedious in the quiz, but I did learn how to create a link for an image(screen shot) that I shot for my computer. So it wasn't entirely tedious but that's the closest I can get to saying something was tedious.
