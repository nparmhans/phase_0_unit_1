I wanted to create a new reflection file so that I was able to seperate the GPS reflection from my code. 

* Forunately for Austin and I this was not our first time pairing up. Last week we wanted to get in a little practice on how a GPS session would go so we went over some current DBC material and got to know each other better. So before the GPS we had already ran a pilot GPS amongst ourselves which ultimately led to great team work. 

* I had a blast doing a TRUE GPS sessiong with the instructor and Austin. 

* I believe what worked best was the luxury of having someone proctor our work and let us know where we can improve out html and css. 

* Nothing, everything was solid.
